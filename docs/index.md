# LEO CDP  
### An Open-Source, AI-First Customer Data Platform

**LEO CDP** is an **open-source, AI-first Customer Data Platform (CDP)** designed to help organizations build, own, and operate their **customer intelligence infrastructure** with full control over data, models, and execution.

Built with **machine learning, big data, and event-driven architecture at its core**, LEO CDP enables unified data collection, real-time analytics, intelligent segmentation, and AI-powered activation—while remaining **self-hosted, extensible, and privacy-respecting by design**.

LEO CDP is engineered for **developers, data engineers, data scientists, and modern marketing teams** who require flexibility, transparency, and long-term scalability beyond closed SaaS platforms.

## 🚀 Vision & Philosophy

LEO CDP is grounded in a clear philosophical direction:

- **From Dataism → USPA → LEO CDP**: data as a first-class asset, intelligence as a system capability  
- Democratize **AI-powered data platforms** for real digital transformation  
- Promote **data sovereignty**, **on-premise intelligence**, and **open collaboration**  
- Shift from rule-based marketing to **agentic, intent-driven customer engagement**

LEO CDP is not just a tool—it is an **architectural framework** for long-term customer intelligence.
